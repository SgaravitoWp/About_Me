## Project Catalogue 
In this section you will see all  my completed and in process projects with a brief description, but Don't worry!, in each directory everything is perfectly explained. 

### Let's see:

1. **Percolation and Critical Probability Project:** In this project, together with my partners Jose Beleno and Luis Rojas, we studied the percolation process through a computational simulation.
2. **Evaluation of Random Number Generation Methods Project. (In progress)**
3. **Jackknife and BootStrap Project:** In this article, together with my partner Julian Pulido, we describe the resampling techniques Jackknifing and Bootstraping accompanied by two use cases implemented in Python and R correspondingly for exemplification.
4. **Bayesian Perspective Project**: In this article a study of Bayes' methodology from the perspective of Math's Criticism is made.
