## Project Catalogue 
In this section you will see all  my completed and in process projects with a brief description, but don't worry, in each directory everything is perfectly explained. 

### Let's see:

1. **Percolation and Critical Probability Project:** In this project, together with my partners Jose Beleno and Luis Rojas, we study the percolation process through a computational simulation.
2. **Evaluation of Random Number Generation Methods Project. (In progress)**
3. **Bayesian Perspective Project. (In progress)**
